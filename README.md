# Unreal Engine Plugin: Shortcut Asset

**Shortcut Asset** is an Unreal Engine plugin that adds asset to open a linked asset/directory.  
This works like a shortcut file in Windows/macOS or a symbolic link in Linux.

Unreal Engine supports the "Collections" and "Favorites" feature to open assets/directories with more accessibility.  
However, these features aggregate the access points, which does not allows you to manage assets flexibly.  
For example, the "Collections" feature can create the access point to the asset, but all access points are aggregated into the Collections category.
It also does not support directory access.  
The "Favourites" feature can create the access point to the directory, but all access points are aggregated to the Favourites category.
It also does not support asset access.  

Shortcut asset overcomes all these problems.
